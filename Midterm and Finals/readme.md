# Midterms and Finals
The midterm and final will be based on the same project proposal, which you will submit as your first Group Assignment due at the start of Week 3. Think of the midterm as a midpoint status report of what will eventually become your final project. In rare cases, you may decide to change your topic from your midterm to your final, but understand that doing so will require a monumental effort on the groups' part to reframe your research, find new datasets, and reproduce relevant material. It is highly recommended that you carefully examine the validity and "doability" of your project before embarking into it. A note of advice: your project is only as good as your data can take you.

## Midterms
There are three deliverables for the mid-term project.
1. Update the project proposal and resubmit
1. Create a Jupyter Notebook that does the following:
      - states the research question
      - identifies data sources
      - data exploration
      - data analysis
      - data visualization 
1. Present your project to the class

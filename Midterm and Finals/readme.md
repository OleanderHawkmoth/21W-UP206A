# Week 1 (10/5): Introduction to spatial data science


## Lecture
*   Overview of the course
*   Expectations
*   Where did ArcMap go?
*   What is Data Science?
*   How is it relevant to planning?
*   Mid-term and final projects will be based on groups (pairings)

## [Hands on](https://github.com/yohman/up206a/tree/master/Weeks/Week%201)
*   Introducing GitHub
*   Introducing JupyterHub
*   Intro to Python

## Individual Assignments
*   Create a GitHub account, and create a project repo named “UP206A”
*   Create a Readme.md file in your GitHub class repo, and introduce your Data Science project space (hint: use this [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
*   Search for and document up to three potential data sources for your own research inquiry; explain how it can be used to answer a potential research question, and how it can be visualized spatially

## Reading assignment
*   This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) about why this article spoke to you in regards to your approach to data and research. The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.

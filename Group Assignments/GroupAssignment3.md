# Group Assignment #3: Data Visualization

For this assignment, you will use data from two sources: Open Street Map (using osmnx), and an Open Data Portal (using sodapy). If you want to use a different source for your data, make sure to consult with me first.

Use pandas and/or geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. For your Open Street Map data, convert it to a geopandas dataframe, and plot them. Each plot should be followed by a markdown cell that describes the urban fabric that is revealed by the plot. 

For your open data, identify at least two variables of interest and calculate relevant descriptive statistics. Using the techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data set. In total, you will create at least 4 visualizations using at least 3 different visualization types (such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, or anything else, including a map). 1 of your visualizations should be a "bad" visualization (that is, does not follow best practices) and the next one should be an improvement of it.

Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting. What story does it tell? How do the visuals enrich, confirm, or contradict the descriptive statistics you calculated earlier? For the "bad" visualization and its improvement, explain what's wrong with the former and how you improved it with the latter.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook).

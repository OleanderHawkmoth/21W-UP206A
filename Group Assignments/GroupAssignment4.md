# Group Assignment #4: Spatial Analysis

This assignment will focus on the spatial component of your data. Choose two datasets, of which at least one is spatial. Join/merge the two datasets together (either a pandas merge or a geopandas spatial join). Project them to a sensible CRS. Using the mapping techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data. Create at least 3 maps. Each map should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains the map's interpretation, the projection that you chose to use, and what you are visualizing and why it is interesting: tell us its story. This story should be accompanied by any relevant descriptive statistics, as needed, to round out the picture.

At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each group member and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each).

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook).

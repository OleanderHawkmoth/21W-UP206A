    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of planning and spatial thinking. In recent years, our relationship with maps and map-making has changed dramatically. No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they can produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance spatial exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares  you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective."

    "The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging."

    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, students will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis\n",
    "- Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research\n",
    "- Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy\n",
    "- Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics\n",
    "- Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps"

    "\n",
    "I would be remiss if I do not mention various inspirations that have led to the creation of this course. First and foremost, the late and great [Leo Estrada](https://luskin.ucla.edu/in-memoriam-leo-estrada-urban-planning-scholar-and-champion-of-diversity), my mentor and confidant over the years (sorry, decades!), who taught GIS at our department for many decades. Leo and I spoke extensively about modifying this course to a more “modern” approach, and I am delighted and honored to uphold his legacy moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I have taken the liberty (with permission) to borrow ideas and materials from other courses. I specifically took inspiration from [Paul Waddell](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/paul-waddell)’s “[Urban Informatics and Visualization](https://github.com/waddell/CP255)” course at UC Berkeley, and [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/about/)’s “[Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public Good](https://github.com/gboeing/ppd534)” at the Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis at USC’s Sol Price School of Public Policy."

The good news is that this course—coding, data, maps!—is situated perfectly for remote learning. Nevertheless, there are some expectations and guidelines I would like to enforce in order to make this experience as fruitful and productive for all of us. First, make sure that your Internet connection and equipment are set up to use Zoom and able to share audio and video during class meetings. Let me know if there is a gap in your technology set-up as soon as possible, and we can see about finding solutions."

    "- Parents or caregivers who anticipate having a child(ren) with them during class sessi ons are encouraged to wear a headset to help minimize background noise. You may mute your microphone and communicate through the chat feature at any point necessary.\n",
    "- Stepping away momentarily for childcare reasons is completely understandable and expected. Simply mute and/or turn off your camera as necessary, and rejoin us when you are able.\n",
    "- I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.\n",

While I maintain the same high expectations for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school-parenting balance."

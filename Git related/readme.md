Here you will find different notes on using git for this course.

For winter quarter 2021, we will be using [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/topic/automatic-merging.html#topic-automatic-merging) to update course material at the start of each lab session. This will ensure that your files are up to date with the instructor.

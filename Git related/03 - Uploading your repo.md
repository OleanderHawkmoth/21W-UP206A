## Uploading to your repo

Once you have authored new content, like a jupyter notebook assignment, you will want to update your repo. Remember, creating a notebook in JupyterHub does not automatically add it to your repo. You have to manually do it.

#### Launch a terminal window
#### pull data from your repo in case your copy is not up to date
```git pull```
#### add all the files you have created, modified, or deleted to your staging area
`git add --all`
#### commit it prior to pushing
`git commit -m "include note as to what is being committed"`
#### push it to your git repo
`git push`

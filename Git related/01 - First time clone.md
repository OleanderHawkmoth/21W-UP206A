# GitHub workflows

The first time you copy, or clone the class repo, do the following steps:

#### Log into the class [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/)
#### Go to New, Terminal
[git terminal](images/gitterminal.png)
#### in the command prompt, type `git clone repository_url`

Note that you now have a _copy_ of the repository. You can make changes as you wish. However, it is recommended that if you want to experiment with an existing file, duplicate it first, and then make changes on your copy.

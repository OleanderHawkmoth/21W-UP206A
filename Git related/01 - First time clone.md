# Getting started each week
At the start of each week, you will be asked to update the class repository. Note that this is different from your own personaly repository. To do so, follow these instructions.

## Week 1
This is the first time you will interact with the class material. You are asked to clone the repository into your JupyterHub.

#### 1. Log into the class [Jupyter Hub](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/)
#### 2. Go to New, Terminal

#### 3. In the command prompt, type (or copy/paste) the following:

`git clone https://github.com/yohman/up206a.git`

You should now have a copy of the class repo in your JupyterHub. Look for a folder `up206a` and navigate to `Weeks` and `Week1`. 

As you will be working on the notebooks (files with an .ipynb extension) during the lecture, *make a copy of these files first*.

To do so, right click on the file, and duplicate as shown below:

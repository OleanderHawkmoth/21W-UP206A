Make sure to read one (or more) of the following papers by Adam:
- The PNAS street-network sprawl paper (https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/1941) is the most elaborate and gets into OSM and street connectivity metrics
- The parking paper (https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1bvYg,M0mRH3NY) is a nice example of dealing with GPS data
- The street width paper ([link-requires password](https://ucla.box.com/s/t6rah5b7pvkjp9vrqxzyafi7n15unswr)) is still a draft, and is simpler in terms of the data science angles but might be more accessible.

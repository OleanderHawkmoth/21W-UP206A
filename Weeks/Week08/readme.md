# Assignments

There are no assignments (hurray!), BUT, do the following:

- meet with your partner at least once
- do a collaborative coding session
- continue to work on your group projects with the [final project deliverables](../../Midterm%20and%20Finals) in mind
- meet with your instructors if you have any issues

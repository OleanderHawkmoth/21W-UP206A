# Week 1 (10/5): Introduction to spatial data science


## Lecture
*   Overview of the course
*   Expectations
*   Where did ArcMap go?
*   What is Data Science?
*   How is it relevant to planning?
*   Mid-term and final projects will be based on groups (pairings)

## [Hands on](https://github.com/yohman/up206a/tree/master/Weeks/Week%201)
*   Introducing GitHub
*   Introducing JupyterHub
    * log into our class JupyterHub
    * when you are in the classic notebook interface, click New, Terminal
    * clone the class repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/yohman/up206a.git`
*   Intro to Python

## Individual Assignments
*   Create a GitHub account, and create a project repo named “UP206A”
*   Create a Readme.md file in your GitHub class repo, and introduce your Data Science project space (hint: use this [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
*   Search for and document up to three potential data sources for your own research inquiry; explain how it can be used to answer a potential research question, and how it can be visualized spatially

## Reading assignment
This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? 

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.

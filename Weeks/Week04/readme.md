Review the [LA Times Coronavirus Tracking page](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/). Check out the accompanying [github page](https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data) that makes available all the data that is used on their tracking page. 

Clone, or download the LA Times github repo into your local drive, and run examples.ipybn.

Submit a one page paper 
- Include your reaction to the LA Times Coronavirus Tracking project. Is this an effective way to communicate their work? How does it address issues of transparency? 
- Ben Welsh, the Data and Graphics Editor of the LA Times, will speak at the Humanitarian Mapathon. Come up with at least two questions you would like to ask him, regarding his work with the coronavirus tracking project. I will select a handful of the questions from our class to ask him during his talk.

## Assignments

### Mini Group Assignment
For this week's group assignment, meet with your partner and submit a status report as a markdown file in your group repo. This will simply be graded as a "done" or "not done" and count towards your participation grade.

Include the following sections:
* **Project title and link to proposal**
* **Roles** (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."
* **Status update**: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
* **Data update**: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
* **Concerns**: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."

### Individual Assignment
Participate in the Humanitarian Mapathon, and do *at least* one of the following:

* Digitize 100 buildings
* Participate in one of the workshops
* Listen to Ben Welsh's closing keynote

Submit a short paragraph on what you did at the mapathon, and provide your thoughts in a GitHub markdown file on your repo titled "week4_individual_assignment"

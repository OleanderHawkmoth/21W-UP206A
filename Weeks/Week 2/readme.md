## Assignments (due 23:59 Sunday, the day before class)
### Group Assignment #1
The course will largely be guided by your final project, which will be conducted in pairs. Meet with your partner, discuss and identify a research question, and begin the collection of data, its analysis, and determine how it may answer your question. Understand that this may change later, especially as we learn more about what we can do with our methods, and also, as you find the data sources that can or cannot support your research.

Next, identify and download at least two datasets that you believe begins to guide your research. Make sure that at least one of them has a spatial component. For example, if one of your dataset comes from the census, identify which survey you will use (e.g. Decennial or American Community Survey), and which variables you will select. Note that we will be covering census data in detail in Week 3. Your second dataset should come from a separate source. For example, you may want to do a crime analysis and obtain data from the LA Data Portal.

*   Write a 1-2 page paper, which will be your group's project proposal. Make sure to include the following:
   *   An introduction of a research topic
   *   An explanation of why it is important to you, and why it matters to others, and what is at stake
   *   A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
   *   A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
       * Include datasource with links

Next, create a group repo. 
1. Select a member of the group who will be the main account holder of the repo
2. Create a new repository for your group project
3. Go to Settings, Manage Access, and add your partner as a collaborator
1. Create a Group Assignments folder (hint: click on Add File, Create new File, and enter "Group Assignments/readme.md" in the text box)
4. Upload (or git push) your your project proposal into the Group Assignments folder

### Individual assignment:
*   Launch JupyterHub, import a dataset of your choice, and conduct data exploration, making sure to document your steps and your preliminary findings
*   Add your first data exploration Jupyter Notebook to your GitHub repository
